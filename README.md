# Git Tag → Release Notes → Jira → Slack (Dev + QA)

This workflow automatically detects a new GitLab tag, validates the version, fetches commit changes, generates release notes, creates a Jira task and sends notifications to separate Slack channels for Development and QA teams.

This workflow starts whenever a new tag such as v1.0.0 is pushed in GitLab. It checks whether the tag format is correct, collects recent commits, prepares release notes, creates a Jira issue for QA testing and sends Slack notifications to Dev and QA teams.

You receive:

- **Automatic release process after GitLab tag push**
- **Auto-generated release notes from commit history**
- **Jira task for QA testing**
- **Separate Slack alerts for Dev and QA teams**

Ideal for teams that want a clean and automated software release process without manual follow-up.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. [Import workflow JSON into your n8n account](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi).
2. Add your GitLab webhook URL in repository settings.
3. Add your GitLab API token in HTTP Request node.
4. Connect your Jira Cloud account.
5. Connect your Slack account.
6. Select Dev and QA Slack channels.
7. Activate the workflow.

## What It Does

This workflow automates release management:

1. Detects new GitLab tag push.
2. Validates semantic version format.
3. Fetches commit changes from GitLab.
4. Generates release notes automatically.
5. Creates Jira issue for testing.
6. Sends release update to Dev Slack channel.
7. Sends testing request to QA Slack channel.
